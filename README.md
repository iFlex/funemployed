# Web Version of FUNemployed
Funemployed is a great card game for those who don't shy away from being silly and love to improvise. 
The essence of the game is that players are interviewed for jobs. You have 6 cards in hand and have ot pick 3 that need to be in your pitch for the job. The employer picks the person with the funniest / most appealing pitch. Each turn a job card is put on the table and a new employer is picked.
